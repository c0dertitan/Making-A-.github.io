# Making A .github.io
So lets say your username is "example101"
and you create a repository called example101.github.io that is step one.
and then go to your repository's settings and go to Pages and you can choose a theme
and then click select theme when over and it will send you to a index.md and write on line one "# example website" and on line two write "this is a test"
and that's how you make one!
